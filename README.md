# Demo-2024

Welcome to 2024 David You came into the year  DEVELOPER and by the end of this year i will be 10times better 


i am starting off with where i stopped , which is interacting with API using postman 
Also discovered there is something called newman ,it is a tool to help manage your API better with postman 
Estate website functionality is at 70% need to keep testing too know what is not allowing the form to submit and to the list of properties 

Practicing managining req/res with an API using postman , trying to understand RESTful/REST API better
REST API is the most common type and protocol for creating an API

going back to spend more time on this Estate Project
i have been able to get the form data to save to local storage using an easier way
it wasnt as complecated as the first way i was trying to , i will push the code to github now
I need to try and make this list of properties appear as it should

I knew this wasnt going to be easy so i just have to keep going 
Progress , KEEP GOING , NO progress KEEP GOING as long as i am on the right track 

There is progress on the Estate project , the form is acting just as it should
is to delete the old server and create a new one , then move from localstorage to the actual server
Need to find a way for the new properties values to show correctly in the list of properties is shown
Estate website coming along well now , after sooo many tirals and errors
New list of properties is now showing , just  few touhes for positioning it 

One this making this website has thought me so far is no matter how fraustrating it gets keep coming back , i will find a way 
by gods grace 
Updated the pagination order of the page
