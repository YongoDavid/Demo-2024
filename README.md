   # Demo-2024 JAN

Welcome to 2024 David You came into the year  DEVELOPER and by the end of this year i will be 10times better 


i am starting off with where i stopped , which is interacting with API using postman 
Also discovered there is something called newman ,it is a tool to help manage your API better with postman 
Estate website functionality is at 70% need to keep testing too know what is not allowing the form to submit and to the list of properties 

Practicing managining req/res with an API using postman , trying to understand RESTful/REST API better
REST API is the most common type and protocol for creating an API

going back to spend more time on this Estate Project
i have been able to get the form data to save to local storage using an easier way
it wasnt as complecated as the first way i was trying to , i will push the code to github now
I need to try and make this list of properties appear as it should

I knew this wasnt going to be easy so i just have to keep going , 
Progress KEEP GOING , NO progress KEEP GOING as long as i am on the right track i cant stop 

There is progress on the Estate project , the form is acting just as it should
is to delete the old server and create a new one , then move from localstorage to the actual server
Need to find a way for the new properties values to show correctly in the list of properties is shown
Estate website coming along well now , after sooo many tirals and errors
New list of properties is now showing , just  few touhes for positioning it 

One thing making this website has thought me so far is no matter how fraustrating it gets keep coming back , i will find a way 
by gods grace 
Updated the pagination order of the page 
updated the visibility of the list of properties page to show 3 properties per page , 
things left to do for this project , creating the server , creating the databse and then linking both 
Start with responsive desgin for mobile , Tablet and desktop 
Still on this estate website , new properties displaying well , only problem is they are displaying on every page , i just need them to display only on new pages 

The most annoying part about coding is when you are faced with a challenge and you keep trying and trying but there is no progress 

Might leave this estate project the way it is since everything is working it's to make the new prperties only display on a new page and not all the pages  
Now MySQLis giving me issues , i have been trying to avoid it since but today i will face it
every root-user i create after a few days the password doesnt work anymore , this has happned twice now and i have had to delete all the files and reinstall them
i thought i had figured it out yesterday but here i during the day still trying to figure it out , Thanks to chantGPT for providing different solutions for me and trying to help me out
MySQL is really giving me hard time
i have tried different ways to install it but it keeps bening annoying 
i dont know what to do again 

since mysql database has decided to stress me for three days now , i took a break from it today 
went back to polish on responsive designs and better my skills on media queries
just need to practice it more in all my projects and make sure all screens work well and as they should 
i will go back to mysql today at midnight hopefully it all goes well with setting up my database 

i have tried again today and mysql still is not acting the way it should , it is from one issue to another
and because if this issues i have been slacking on works i am meant to do since , because it involves the use of a dabase 
so far i have just been using localstorage to store data 
the painful thing is that i should have gotten far and covered alot if not for this issues of the database 
and another issue is i havent been coding well the past few days , not as much as i have been wanting to which is making me annoyed at myself 

the pending projects i have are the properties website , the blog website and the project full stack website i am meant to start
created new folders in my server for the "My-blogs" application 
created folders for the "controllers" , "middlewares" , "config" e.t.c

finally again after weeks and days of hassle , MqSQL is noow working , i got it installed using Homebrew  ,the initial error when installing didnt show again 
Password saved and working as it should , all Thanks to God 
workbench and my server versions are not compatabale right now but server , workbench and the database is working just fine , the compatability is not a critical issue
now i can delve into MySQL proper and run all the database long needed for my projects  

practicws a little with mysql and getting a hand of it 
practiced interacting with api using postman 
created database for the properties project , and created for the blogs project 
i just have to link the database to thier own websites and test if it is working 

Now moving on to the next project which is my main project , starting with the front end
started my main project which is an E-commerce web application 
starting with mobile first then i will scale up to other screen 

i have gone far with my project , with just the front-end and that is for the mobile , i am just left with the profile side 
the pages i have done so far for the mobile are : the home page , the About Us page , the Contact Us page  , the login page , the sign up and the cart page 
now lets move to all these for desktop / laptop screen 

Just when i thought i have gone far with my E commerce project and done with the mobile screens , i have to start again because is isnt going as i thought 
hopefully i get it sorted out and i can move to the functionality of the web app ny wednesday 
wish me luck 

i am sooo frustrated  , time is runnning and still i havent been able to figure out this laptop home view for laptop screens only 
i adjusted for mobile screens and it is working perfectly now
if i am not able to sort out this latptop screen view today i will just leave it and move on to the functionality of this website because there is no time to waste here 

laptop screen design going well , i need to finish it by todat in other to move on to the functionality 
footer area needs some work to be done to it , but for now it is ok 
i cant stooo i need to keep going no matter how difficult it might be 
once i have stopped i have lost 

1:55am and after trying and trying to fix all the screens to work properly for my E project the design is 80% done 

Now moving on to funactionality for My Hiit project
Today is a new day ,and i have to continue with the functionality of the e-market project
the main task for today is to handle the server and functionality for the login , sign up and creating users for the website and after this i will move on to the next thing 
done with the functionality for login , signup , creating user and the server 
i just need some finishing touches on the server and create my database which i will link to the server 

i am trying to test my database but the form is not sending its input to the database
need to get a cloud database for my database to work as it should 
since i havent gotten a cloud database yet i tried using postman to just test myapi and try siging up but here comes another issue , from one thing to the other 

its time i move on to something else on this e-commerce project and after come back to the issue at hand later in the day 
still going to work on this project but just  a different section , so i can get other things done and on the front-end and goo back to the back-end 
the things i want to do today for this project are , create a border around every item that is being sold for them to have thier own individial container 

I have added to cart section remaining its functionality , looking good on mobile and laptop , 
what is left is to center all product images and create the profile page and edit page then make sure all the routing for everyday is done 
Now its time for me to move to adding and removing items from the cart 

4:13 am 29th jan 2024 and i am still up trying to make this e-commerce app work , this iss now my night have been for three night now because i have a deadline 
and itss just one issue to another with these codes

i asked for help from someone concerning the issuses i was facing with my sever and account controllers and she helped me to solve it ,sometimes all you need is to ask for help from someone working oon something similar 

Deadline for my e-commerce website is tomorrow  , now its time for me to host the client and server side of my project and maybe get a cloud database to host my server on
the deadline to submit my project was today and i was able to submit it yesterday at mind night 
now i am trying to host my server and then run some finishing touches , which are being annoying right now 
well this is the life i choose , solving problmes and bulidng things are never easy but with time they will be 

WEkk this is tthe end of january , it was an amzing month coding / programming from oone project to another and handling one problem to another 
Submited my project , did my defended it and wrote my exam which was amazing 

YOU ARE AMAZING DAVID , KEEP PROGRAMMING NO MATTER HOW HARD IT GETS , IF IT WAS EASY EVERYONE WOULD BE DOING IT
